Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects cats worldwide. The virus can cause a range of health problems, including immunodeficiency and cancer. FeLV is one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting cats, and it is a leading cause of death in infected cats. This article will cover how FeLV causes disease, how a cat can get FeLV, how to test for FeLV, whether there is a vaccination for FeLV, and how to protect our cats from contracting FeLV.

### How does FeLV cause disease?

FeLV primarily affects the immune system of cats, leading to immunodeficiency. The virus infects and destroys white blood cells, including T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, which are essential for fighting off infections. As a result, infected cats become more susceptible to infections and are unable to fight off the infections as efficiently as healthy cats. FeLV can also cause cancer, such as leukemia and lymphoma, which can be fatal.

### What is the outcome of disease?

The outcome of FeLV infection varies depending on several factors, including the cat's age, health status, and immune system. Some infected cats may show no symptoms and live a normal life span. In contrast, others may develop severe illnesses, such as anemia, weight loss, and tumors, which can lead to death. The risk of developing severe illnesses is higher in cats that have weakened immune systems.

### How does a cat get FeLV?

FeLV is highly contagious and is primarily spread through close contact with infected cats. The virus is shed in high amounts in saliva, tears, urine, and feces of infected cats, and can be transmitted through mutual grooming, sharing of food and water bowls, and litter boxes. Mother cats can also transmit the virus to their kittens during pregnancy, birth, or through milk.

### How do we test for FeLV?

Testing for FeLV is essential in diagnosing and managing the infection. The most common method of testing is a blood test that detects FeLV antigens or antibodies. The test is quick and easy and can be performed in a veterinary clinic. If a cat tests positive, the veterinarian may recommend further testing to assess the extent of the infection and the cat's overall health.

### Is there a vaccination for FeLV?

Yes, there is a vaccination for FeLV. The vaccine is highly effective and can prevent infection in most cats. The vaccine is recommended for all cats, especially those at high risk of exposure, such as outdoor cats and cats living in multi-cat households. However, vaccination does not guarantee complete protection, and cats should still be monitored and tested regularly for FeLV.

### How can we best protect our cats from contracting FeLV?

The best way to protect our cats from contracting FeLV is by taking preventive measures. Cats should be kept indoors, especially if they are not vaccinated, to minimize their exposure to infected cats. Multi-cat households should have separate food and water bowls, litter boxes, and sleeping areas for each cat. Regular veterinary checkups and testing can also help detect FeLV infection early and manage the disease effectively.

In conclusion, FeLV is a serious infectious disease that can cause severe health problems and even death in infected cats. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted through close contact with infected cats. Vaccination and preventive measures, such as keeping cats indoors and providing separate resources for each cat, can help protect our feline companions from contracting FeLV. Regular testing and veterinary checkups are crucial in diagnosing and managing the infection.
