        If you enjoy spending time with cats and are interested in helping homeless cats, then fostering one in your home may be a good option for you. You get to experience the joy of spending time with a pet. It teaches children compassion and the importance of treating animals with kindness.

    >
        If you're interested in fostering as a prelude to adoption, you can use your fostering time to truly get to know a cat before you adopt him or her.<br/> You can have the satisfaction of knowing that you helped save a life.  Because of space limitations, we have to say 'no' to many cats that need our help. If you foster, you will play a vital part in helping a cat that otherwise would have been euthanized at a shelter.
