    Long Beach Felines is an all-volunteer organization formalized in 2008 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. We have no paid staff and receive no government funding.  We rely on fundraising efforts and private donations to support our cause and provide food, supplies and medical care for our cats. We are a no-kill organization that only euthanizes cats when it is medically deemed the only humane option.
