### Contributing

Long Beach Felines is a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming cats in the Long Beach area. We provide shelter, food, medical care, and love to cats in need, and work hard to find loving homes for these felines.

However, running a cat rescue shelter is not easy, and we rely on the support of generous donors to keep our operations going. Every donation, no matter how small, can make a huge difference in the lives of our cats. 

Your donation will help provide food, medical care, and other necessities for the cats in our care. By donating to Long Beach Felines, you can make a real impact on the lives of cats in need. Please consider making a donation today to support the important work that we are doing. Your contribution can truly make a difference!
