### Volunteering

Long Beach Felines heavily relies on volunteers to support its efforts to help as many cats as possible. If you are an animal lover, and would like to contribute to a good cause, you can apply using the form on this page.

Volunteers are needed to help at adoption events, which are held regularly throughout the year. At these events, volunteers assist with setting up and breaking down the event, handling cats, answering questions from potential adopters, and completing adoption paperwork. This role requires good communication skills, as well as patience and the ability to work with a team.          

Socializing cats is another way that volunteers can help Long Beach Felines. This involves spending time with cats and kittens to help them become comfortable around people. Socializing cats can help them become more adoptable, and it can be a fun and rewarding experience for volunteers who enjoy spending time with animals.

Fundraising and development is another important aspect of Long Beach Felines' work, and volunteers are needed to help with this task. This role involves planning and executing fundraising events, seeking out donations and sponsorships, and working on grant applications. Volunteers with strong organizational and communication skills are well-suited to this role.

Additionally volunteers can help with publicity and advertising by creating social media posts, designing flyers and brochures, and promoting events and adoption opportunities. This role requires creativity and a strong understanding of social media and marketing.

Finally, Long Beach Felines operates a phone hotline to help people with questions about cat care and to report cats in need. Volunteers are needed to staff this hotline, and this role requires good communication skills, empathy, and a willingness to learn about cat care.
